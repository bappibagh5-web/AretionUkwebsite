    <h3>1. Policy Statement</h3>
    <p>ARETION & Company and its subsidiaries are committed to identifying, disclosing, and managing conflicts of interest fairly, transparently, and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. A conflict of interest arises where personal or financial interests, relationships, or commitments could—or could be perceived to—influence professional judgment, create a breach of duty to ARETION or our clients, or compromise our independence and objectivity.</p>
    <p>This policy applies to all employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, agents, partners, and anyone representing ARETION & Company in the United Kingdom, Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait), and all other jurisdictions where we operate.</p>

    <h3>2. Our Commitment to Independence and Objectivity</h3>
    <p>Our core values include Independence and Objectivity. We provide impartial, evidence-based advice and do not allow conflicts of interest, personal relationships, financial ties, or client preferences to compromise our professional judgment. Conflicts of interest are common in professional life and are not necessarily prohibited. However, they must be disclosed and properly managed.</p>

    <h3>3. What is a Conflict of Interest?</h3>
    <p>A conflict of interest exists when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your personal interests conflict with your duties to ARETION or our clients</li>
      <li>You have competing loyalties or obligations</li>
      <li>Your judgment could reasonably be perceived to be compromised</li>
      <li>You could personally benefit (directly or indirectly) from a decision or action</li>
      <li>Your relationship with another person or organization creates actual or perceived bias</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A conflict can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Actual:</strong> a real conflict exists now</li>
      <li><strong>Potential:</strong> circumstances could develop into a conflict</li>
      <li><strong>Perceived:</strong> a reasonable observer might perceive a conflict exists, even if it does not</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All three types must be disclosed and managed.</p>

    <h3>4. Types of Conflicts of Interest</h3>
    <h4>4.1 Financial Conflicts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ownership of shares, securities, or financial interest in a client, competitor, supplier, or organization we advise</li>
      <li>Financial interest in a company, product, or technology that we recommend to clients</li>
      <li>Receipt of personal payment, commission, referral fee, or financial benefit from a third party connected to our work</li>
      <li>Investment portfolios that could be affected by advice we give</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.2 Relational Conflicts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Family relationships (spouse, partner, parent, child, sibling, or other close relative) with clients, competitors, suppliers, government officials, or colleagues in positions of influence</li>
      <li>Close personal friendships or intimate relationships that could influence professional judgment</li>
      <li>Previous close working relationships with clients or their representatives</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.3 Professional Conflicts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Outside employment, consultancy, advisory work, or business interests with clients, competitors, or related organizations</li>
      <li>Board positions, trustee roles, or advisory positions with organizations that could conflict with ARETION's interests</li>
      <li>Simultaneous advice to competing clients on related or overlapping matters</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Your Obligation to Disclose</h3>
    <p>You must disclose any actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interest:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At recruitment: During the hiring process</li>
      <li>Before joining a project: If you have or become aware of a conflict relevant to a new project</li>
      <li>As soon as you become aware: If circumstances change and a new conflict arises</li>
      <li>Annually: All employees must complete an annual conflicts of interest declaration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disclose conflicts by emailing compliance@aretion.co.uk with full details or informing your manager verbally and following up in writing.</p>

    <h3>6. How We Manage Conflicts of Interest</h3>
    <p>Once a conflict is disclosed, ARETION will assess it and take one or more of the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Action Required:</strong> If the conflict is minimal or can be quickly resolved</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Due Diligence:</strong> Higher-risk activities require enhanced due diligence, approval, and monitoring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Independence in Healthcare Consulting</h3>
    <p>Given ARETION's role in healthcare consulting and advisory services, maintaining independence is critical to patient safety and ethical practice. When providing advice that affects patient care, clinical pathways, or health system operations, we ensure patient safety is paramount in all recommendations and that clinical decisions are based on evidence, not commercial relationships.</p>

    <h3>8. Consequences of Non-Compliance</h3>
    <p>Failure to disclose or properly manage conflicts of interest is a serious breach of this policy and the Code of Conduct. Consequences may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal</li>
      <li>Removal from projects or client engagements</li>
      <li>Loss of professional registration or regulatory sanctions</li>
      <li>Legal liability (civil or criminal, depending on circumstances)</li>
    </ul>
